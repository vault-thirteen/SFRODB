# SFRODB

This repository contains two products which are dependent of each other and may 
be considered to be two parts of a single product:

1. SFRODB
2. SFHS

The first one is the _Simple File Read-Only DataBase_.  
The second one is the _Static Files HTTP Server_.  
The second product is an _HTTP_ front-end part for the _SFRODB_ database.

Each of these two products has its own description file.
1. [SFRODB](doc/SFRODB/ReadMe.md)
2. [SFHS](doc/SFHS/ReadMe.md)

## Notes

Please, do note that earlier in the past time, _SFRODB_ and _SFHS_ were stored 
in two separate repositories. At present time, two these interdependent 
products are stored in a single repository. All files of the _SFHS_ repository 
were merged into the _SFRODB_ repository.

# SFRODB
## Simple File Read-Only DataBase
A very simplistic database engine which stores information in files and 
provides read-only access to data. 

The architecture of this engine implies simplicity in all possible aspects. 
Data is stored in files which are very easy to use and do not need complicated 
mechanisms or libraries. To reduce the frequency of disk operations and to 
increase the data retrieval speed the database engine uses an internal cache of 
popular items stored in random access memory (RAM). The network protocol is 
also very simple â€“ the database uses its own very simple network protocol based 
on the TCP/IP. Only data retrieval operations are supported making this engine 
suitable for sharing of static content.  

An example of a client can be found in the `example\client` folder.

## Caching

Retrieved items automatically get into the cache to avoid future reads from a 
file storage. If for some reason a user wants to update the data file in the 
storage, the cached data must be removed from the cache, the API provides such 
functionality.  

## Dual Port Architecture
To provide additional protection, database uses separate ports for read 
operations and for non-read operations. By non-read operations we mean methods 
for removing a single item from cache and methods for cache cleaning, i.e. 
resetting the cache to an empty state.

## Pool of Clients
The library provides not only a single client for this database. A pool of 
clients is also available. The pool is able to fix broken connections 
automatically and has an adjustable size.

## Building
Use the `build.bat` script included with the source code.

## Installation
`go install github.com/vault-thirteen/SFRODB/cmd/client@latest`  
`go install github.com/vault-thirteen/SFRODB/cmd/server@latest`  

## Startup Parameters

### Server
`server.exe <path-to-configuration-file>`

Example:  
`server.exe "settings.dat"`

### Sample Client
`client.exe <server's host name> <server's main port> <server's aux port>`

Example:  
`client.exe localhost 12345 12346`

## Settings
Format of the settings' file can be learned by studying the source code.
